Stackdeck is a tool to view multiple Stackexchange sites at once.  \

Planned features:  \
The ability to see the same kind of information on a question's preview as you could on SE (upvotes, is-answered, etc) at a glance.  \
The ability to add or remove panels. I'm working on it! Just wanted to get this git up first.  \
The ability to edit panel information (show or not show question body? Show or not show upvotes?)  \
Save panels w/ cookies.  \

Not planned feature:  \
The ability to read and answer questions with your SE account. Questions are just links. Click them if you wish to answer.  \
